Before submit checklist:

Description of things in HTML/JavaScript to excel on: 

Area 1:  HTML, CSS, and graphics for page layout and design

Area 2:  JavaScript interactivity to improve user experience  (e.g., from simple to more complex: mouse hovers, form validation, hide/show, auto-completion, drag and drop, etc.)


Plan:

Have dropdown bar with options of other schools but when you select them message pops up saying, this shool is not supported at this time

Has search bar at top with same functionality as one on page and as a result takes you to the same page

Contact us somewhere in footer 


new things leared: 
   overflow tells you wether to clip content or add scrollbars when elements content is to big to fit into area
   if display: block can have width and height specifically set
   if display: block can have width and height specifically set, if not will only cover what it needs
   if display: inline, means doesn't start on new lline and margins and padding affect horizontal space
   Using Auto with image preserves aspect ratio 
   Bottom border is really easy 
   Variable fonts can have their weights changed while non-variable (our logo) can not 
   Span Tag 
   justify-content: center; aligns elements in center of flex box 
   

Future Notes:
