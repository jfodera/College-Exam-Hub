Future Notes: 
   Slogan (*for now): Crush Exam Day. 
   Replace Background with brain. 
   only identifier is email. 
   when making comments have anonymous option. 
   I say we either have ratings or upvotes, not both, which do we thing. 

User personas:
Bob - student trying to find practice tests,  big Data Structures exam coming up. 
   If Bob has trouble with a problem, he can ask a question about it and talk to other students about it.
   Bob has an easier time finding practice tests for his DS exam he is taking since he can search for content from specific courses.
   The professor for his class changed and now the professor doesnâ€™t provide back exams to its students, so Bob uses college exam hub to solve this issue.

Mike - Physics 1 mentor trying to get problems to prepare students for practice test and save some time by getting a few problems from older tests. He chooses to not log in with his RPI email. 
   He can help students by answering questions, rating tests, and leaving comments.
   Test ratings save Mike time because he can just ignore the older tests with less relevant material.
   He can comment if a topic in a practice test is not included in current tests (help practice tests stay relevant to the current class), if he decided to log in.
