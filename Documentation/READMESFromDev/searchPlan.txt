Overall Plan: 
   This searchbar works in the header and on felipe exam page
   Will be a script specific to search bar that will be pasted into each pages javascript file as so that we can edit the relative links
   non-positioning related styling of search bar in header footer.css for now and get esit that


Potential Places of error: 


To Still do: 

   
Current Push


If time permits: 
   coloring of header when page minimizes


Things I learned: 
   Outer wrapper of searchbar is there to keep the icons within the bar


current Commit: 
   Finished searchbar and autocomplete (only travels when autocomplete things are added)
   added some confirm email functionality -> only needs to work with Find Exams page

Better implementations for the future: 
   figure out how to make one document for searchbar that works with all pages  
      If have time make -> results page and 
      have search image initiate a trip to the results page  when actually hit enter
   Add keydown to autocompletion
   resizing of x icon


Then onto searchbar/header functionality dev: 
   search image icon along with clear icon (javascript clears the box) 
      entire search bar functionality
   when logges in change confirm university email to welcome
