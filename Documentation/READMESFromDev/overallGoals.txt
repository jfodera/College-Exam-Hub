crush exam day is our motto

Very Important!!!: Don’t Use Anything that we don’t understand, make sure you understand everything you wrote.

●	Drop file function makes new landing page for the file

Area 1  HTML, CSS, and graphics for page layout and design, Definite Features: 
   Custom Logo
   consistent header and footer
   navbar, breadcrums 

Area 2:  JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, interactivity to improve user experience  (e.g., from simple to more complex: mouse hovers, form validation, hide/show, auto-completion, drag and drop, etc.)
   
   Drop file function makes new landing page for the pdf by reading information about it

   We want javascript functionality where we select the class we want (using course selector bar on page 4)
       to drop the file
      then opening a directory and launching a new page for that file probably using AJAX
      Use AJAX Lecture for reading in JSON and creating new HTML, just try to do this with pdf 

   Search Bar functionality to present list of courses using Javascript, once you click on one of those courses, takes you to a link with that courses "homepage" 

   any other functional aspects seen in balsamic 


Overall Rules for consistency: 
   make with of pretty much all elements % so that will resize when the page does

Big Things I added: 
   Course List file
   This file
   Base level header 
   Resized PNG image to cut out borders 
   Updated file organization 
   Added issues 

Other Notes: 
   I think we should fully go over and agree with IA before moving into our seperate branches, we should also make rules and conventions for how to document our changes and 
   what files each of us can change and not change as to not have crazy conflicts when trying to merge, should talk about this wednesday

Future Things to add: 
   add a supported courses page with list of supported course  
   Breadcrum functionality to most pages 
   Header de-evolves and just has tiny logo in top left when opening exam specific page
