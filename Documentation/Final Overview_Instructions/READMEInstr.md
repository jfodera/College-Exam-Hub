To open College Exam Hub, the user has to navigate to https://foderjrpi.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/team2/CEH/index.html; this will take them to the home page. In the main area of this page, the user can select a school from the dropdown menu, but currently, RPI is the only one being supported. After selecting the school the user can click on the find exams button to go to the find exams page, where they can upload or search for an exam. 

If the user wants to upload an exam, they can drag and drop the exam they want to upload or click the choose file button to select a file from their file explorer. From there, if they choose to delete the file, they can click on the file itself inside the target box. If they choose to upload, they need to select the course the exam is for from the dropdown and click the upload button at the bottom of the target box.

On each course page, the page displays each exam. The user can use the two drop-down menus at the top of the page to choose what kind of exams to view (ex. midterm, final, etc.), and sort the exams displayed by the year they were given, the overall rating, and the number of ratings. When the user clicks on an exam, the user is taken to its respective landing page, where they can print or download the exam, and rate the exam.

There is a consistent header and footer on multiple pages, such as the home page, the exam upload page, and each course landing page, in which the user can use the search bar to navigate between courses at any time. The header contains buttons for the home page, the page listing all the courses, a search bar utilizing autocomplete that takes the user to the landing page of the course they are searching for, and an email confirmation button. Also, the footer has links to the College Exam Hub Discord server (in which users can ask any questions) and the GitHub repository for this application.

The exam upload and rating functionalities currently do not do anything; ratings and files are not saved. The “Confirm Email” buttons are also not fully implemented, as they do not yet support redirecting you to a page in which you would confirm your email.



*IMPORTANT NOTES* 

*The virtual machine must be running for all of these functionalities to be present.*

*Note to grader: we implemented our search bar using absolute links. This means if you view our code in live preview, the search bar will not work correctly. To make the switch to a testing environment easier, we have included the corresponding relative links (in reference to index.html) above each absolute link*
